A base code to demonstrate clean code practices related to conditional expressions:
- **master** branch: the bad & ugly code :)
- **main-solution** branch: a possible solution. Each commit on this branch is a refactoring step, and could illustrate a refactoring approach
- **advanced-solution** branch: another possible solution, more advanced

# Instructions
Checkout the **master** branch and try to remove bad code smells in _src/tennis/_ folder using refactoring techniques.
When finished, look at solution in the other branches.
